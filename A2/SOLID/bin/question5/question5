1. Separated all the classes specific to the functionality 
 CountryGDPReport.java only gives the report 
 
2. Higher level classes also do not depend on the lower classes after the re factoring
 
 3. GetGDPofDifferentSectors.java is OPEN for implementing future common methods from any of the countries
 Also GetGDPofDifferentSectors.java can be implemented to new country type.
 
 Every new country type will have its own implementation and it is true for the CountryGDPReport.java class also :  they are closed for modifications
